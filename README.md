# portfolio-prep

Visitors to your portfolio site want to learn about you, in memorable, bite-sized bits. Your page will have a space for you to fill in each of the following descriptions of yourself:

A two or three word catchy title. Do NOT use cliches like “programming ninja” or “coding rockstar”.
A personal headline, like you have atop your LinkedIn page. What do you want your career to be about?
Your professional pitch: You’ve done a recording, so just write down here how it goes.
What excites you the most about tech? Write 1-2 sentences.
Gather your assets
A few punchy images will really help your page stand out, and make it your own. Gather images for the following:

A headshot of your wonderful face, approximately 200x250 pixels.
A background image, approximately 1500x700 pixels.
At least three screenshots of the best-looking parts of a previous project, like your Code 201 final project.
At least three screenshots each, of two other projects you have worked on. Salmon Cookies? Odd Duck?
